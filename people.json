After the wars of the First and Second Coalitions, Napoleon overthrew the weakened French Directory to become the First Consul of the Republic. Five years later, he was elected Emperor of the French. At its greatest extent, Napoleon's empire encompassed most of continental Europe, and he lead the Grand Arm√©e to spectacular victories against three more coalitions, including the Battle of Austerlitz, which resulted in the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire finally crumbled under the 6th and 7th Coalitions, and Napoleon, victim to his own ambition, lost all that he had struggled to obtain.",
